  - `ConsoleOutputSettings:LogLevel`
  - `Tor:*` (Enabled, ChangingChainInterval, Socks/Control)
  - `MessageDelaySettings:*`
  - `AppSettings:Proxy`
  - `AccessPolicy:*`
  - Downloader parameters in `downloader-config.json`

**How to connect members of your media circle:**

1. **🔄 Initiate Connection**
   Send the `/start` command and click the *"Add Contact"* button in the menu.
   → The bot will request a **unique link** from the user, like:
   `1234ab56-cde-78fg-01hi-2j34k56790`

2. **🔗 Exchange Identifiers**
   - Your link can be found in the *"My Link"* section.
   - Share it with future contacts — for example, via a QR code or a private message.

3. **🤝 Confirm the Contact**
   - Paste the received link into the input field and send it to the bot.
   - If everything is correct, you’ll see a brief user profile.

4. **⏳ Wait for a Response**  
   - Your request will be sent to the recipient, and they will receive a notification.  
   - Once they accept the invitation (via the *"Review Incoming Requests"* section), you can start exchanging content with each other.  
> [!TIP]
> Don’t hesitate to use groups: Contacts can and should be grouped into different categories like `Colleagues`, `Friends`, `Bird Lovers Society 🐦‍⬛️` — for targeted distribution to multiple contacts at once.

## 🚀 Downloading and Forwarding Content — Magic in Three Steps

### 📥 Working with Links
Simply send the bot a **link + description (if needed, and always on a new line)** in the format:
```
https://youtu.be/your_awesome_video  
Check out this cosmic dance of the northern lights! 🌌 #nature #wow 
```  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use a description, make sure it starts on a new line!

→ The bot will handle the rest:  
1. Identify the platform — whether it’s YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, or any other service.
2. Download the content in optimal quality (with the ability to customize preferences in the configuration). 
3. Forward the video exactly where and to whom it needs to go. ✨

### 🔄 Automatic Distribution
- Your file will instantly be sent to all specified contacts from your list.
   Conditions:
      Contacts must be in your list.
      You must not be muted by these contacts.
      Distribution settings must be configured correctly.
> [!TIP]
> *Tip: Use hashtags in the description!*  
>   *This will allow you to easily find content in chat history. For example, search by tags like #cats or #work.*  
>      *Built-in hashtags also work, but custom ones are more convenient and personalized.*
